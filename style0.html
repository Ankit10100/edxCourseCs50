  <body>
  <h1 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">Welcome to my web page</h1>    
  <p> This is a paragraph of text: </p>
  <p>This is another para of text</p>
    <!--
      What we have with h1 is 2 css properties.
      What we are saying is we want to assign color property to this heading and also text-align property to this heading,
      Whose attributes are blue & center

      There are 140 different colors

      We can also specify the color we want by using the R G B value (each of RGB values in range 0 to 255)

      We can also use hex code:
      #0c8e05 (R: 12,  G: 142, B: 5)
      0c: 12
      8e: 142
      05: 5

      If we add alot of styling in teh HTML page its gonna get cluttered very fast.
      So more cleaner way is we will see in style1.html
    -->
