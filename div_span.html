    <!--
      div defines vertical section of the web page. And Id is the name we want to give to that section.
      Span lets me assign the elements of my web page to a class

      When I am giving Id to the section, Id should be unique across the page.
      But I can give same class to as many elements as I want.

      By doing this I can refer to all the elements that belong to class "name" and style them in a particaular way.

      In the style section before if I would have applied style to div it would have applied to all the divs.
      Now I can apply it to the particular div I want with help of Id.

      "#" mean Id.
      "." means class.

      Div is usually applied to bunch of HTML elements 
      Span is used to group small elements, ususlly inside a paragraph.

      We can also use class with div and Id with span, but the only thing to take care is id should be unique across the page.
